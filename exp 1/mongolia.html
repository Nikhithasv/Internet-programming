                        Mongolia is one of the rich natural countries in the world. 
                        Because there are 7 natural zones: such as High Mountain Zone, 
                        Taiga Forest Zone, Mountain Forest Steppe Zone, Steppe Zone, 
                        Desert-Steppe Zone, Gobi Desert Zone, Wetlands. 
                        For example: Mongolian from north to south it can be divided 
                        into four natural zones: mountain-forest steppe, mountain steppe 
                        and, in the extreme south, semi-desert and desert. 
                        HIGH MOUNTAIN ZONE: All Mongolia is "mountain", the country 
                        averaging 1.5 kilometers above the sea level. 
                        In Mongolian terms, 5%is at such high altitude as to endure extreme 
                        condition -the High Mountain Zone - winds, extreme cold, and very 
                        short growing season. The Zone is above the tree line, characterized 
                        by tundra, alpine- sedge meadows, upland swamps and lichen- 
                        covered screes and boulders. Plants include shrubby Ground Birch; 
                        occasion Mountain Pine, beautiful white Gentian and Mountain Saxifrage. 
                        Typical mammals are "Argali", Ibex, Snow leopard, Ermine, Snow Marten 
                        and Mountain Hare, birds include White Ptarmigan, Altai Snow cock,

                        Morin khuur, national instrument. It has ancient origins 
                        and is purely Mongolian musical instrument. Once upon time 
                        there was a poor man. He had a wonderful steed. The horse was 
                        a special one; it was faster than bird and could instantaneously 
                        cover great distances. But one day he found his horse dead 
                        near his ger. So his heartbroken, he began to make a fiddle 
                        from his horse's bones, tendons and hair. Then he fixed the 
                        horse's head to the handle and overcome with grief, 
                        lay his own head on it to unite himself spiritually to his dead friend. 
                        So he started to playing the Morin huur describing his beloved 
                        steed's steps, gallop, hurdle, trotting, and neighing. 
                        Thus goes the ancient legend of the illians about the origin of the morin huur.
                        It is a square fiddle with the long, straight handle curved at 
                        the tip and topped with the carving of a horse's head. 
                        It is said to represent the movement and sounds of a horse. 
                        Every Mongolian family strives to have a morin khuur in their 
                        ger even though they are hand-made and fairly expensive instruments.
