                        One of the oldest civilisations in the world, 
                        India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. 
                        With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, 
                        the country is among the most popular tourist 
                        destinations in the world. 
                        It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km,
                        extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to 
                        the tropical rain forests of the south. 
                        As the 7th largest country in the world, 
                        India stands apart from the rest of Asia, 
                        marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, 
                        which give the country a distinct geographical entity.
                        Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, 
                        it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, 
                        tapers off into the Indian Ocean between 
                        the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. 
                        As you travel the expanse of the country, 
                        you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, 
                        faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes,
                         history and adventure sports. 
                        India has a mesmeric conflation of the old and the new.
                        As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping malls,
                        and majestic monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels,
                        the quintessential traveller can get the best of both worlds. 
                        Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat or cruise through 
                        the golden Thar,India has options galore for all.

                        Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and 
                        technologies that originated in or are associated with
                        the ethno-linguistically diverse India.The term also applies 
                        beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are 
                        strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, 
                        particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia.
                        India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and
                        customs differ from place to place within the country.
                        Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures,
                        has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old,
                        beginning with the Indus Valley civilization and other early cultural areas.
                        Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics,
                        philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies have had a profound 
                        impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world. Specifically,
                        Southeast Asian and Himalayan influence on early India had lasting impacts on
                        the formation of Hinduism and Indian mythology. 
                        Hinduism itself formed from various distinct folk religions,
                        which merged during the Vedic period and following periods.
                        Especially Austroasiatic groups, such as early Munda and Mon Khmer, 
                        but also Tibetic and other Tibeto-Burmese groups, left noteworthy influence 
                        on local Indian peoples and culture. Several scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, 
                        among others, concluded that there is a significant cultural, linguistic, and 
                        political Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic) influence on early India, 
                        which can also be observed by Austroasiatic loanwords within Indo-Aryan languages 
                        and rice cultivation, which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian 
                        rice-agriculturalists using a route from Southeast Asia through Northeast India 
                        into the Indian subcontinent.The British Raj further influenced Indian culture, 
                        such as through the widespread introduction of the English language,
                        and a local dialect developed.
