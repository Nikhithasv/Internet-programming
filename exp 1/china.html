                        China, the largest of all Asian countries, occupies nearly 
                        the entire East Asian landmass and covers approximately 
                        one-fourteenth of the land area of Earth, making 
                        it almost as large as the whole of Europe.China, which has 
                        the largest population of any country in the world, 
                        is composed of diverse ethnic and linguistic groups. 
                        The Han are the largest group in China, while the Zhuang is
                        the largest minority group. In some areas of China, 
                        especially in the southwest, many different ethnic groups are 
                        geographically intermixed, including Buyi, Miao, 
                        Dong, Tibetans, Mongolians, and others.The official language 
                        of China is Mandarin, or putonghua, 
                        meaning “ordinary language” or “common language.” 
                        There are three variants of Mandarin—Beijing, Chengdu, and Nanjing. 
                        Of these, the Beijing dialect is the most widespread Chinese tongue 
                        and has officially been adopted as the basis for the national language.

                        Chinese culture is one of the world’s oldest cultures, 
                        tracing back to thousands of years ago. Important 
                        components of Chinese culture includes ceramics, architecture,
                        music, literature, martial arts, cuisine, visual arts, philosophy 
                        and religion.Ethnic Groups-Officially there are 56 recognized 
                        ethnic groups in China, Han Chinese being the largest group. 
                        Many ethnic groups, though merge into Han identity, 
                        have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions. 
                        Even within one ethnic group, there are probably diverse groups of people.
                        Various groups of the Miao minority, for example, speak different dialects 
                        of the Hmong-Mie languages, Tai-Kadai languages, and Chinese, and 
                        practice a variety of different cultural customs. 
                        Typically each minority group has their own costumes, festivals and customs. 
                        For example, various marriage customs  are found among different minority groups. 
                        There is actually a museum that features marriage customs of ethnic groups-Guizhou 
                        Museum of Marriage Customs.
